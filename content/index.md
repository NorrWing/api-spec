# App.net API Spec

This is a living, working document. The API is functional, but we're in the early implementation stages of what App.net will be, and we'd like your feedback, suggestions and ideas. Please help us make this into something much bigger than it currently is.

Please submit feedback to us — feel free to comment on commits, open issues, open pull requests, etc.

#### What's New

* Introducing the Messaging API — check out the documentation for [Channels](/docs/resources/channel/) and [Messages](/docs/resources/message/).
* New look for documentation!

#### Very Important Warning

**If you're submitting your application to one of Apple's App Stores, we suggest you implement authentication via the [Password Flow](/docs/authentication/password-flow/) section or it's possible your app will be rejected.**

#### Wait, I wanted a syndication protocol that can do X, Y and Z!

We're thinking about the best way to do this. It's something we're interested in providing, but since we've gotta start somewhere, we decided it would be best to start with an API defined in terms of things that the majority of developers are already familiar with.

We want to think big with you. What would you like to see?

#### How do I get involved?

Open an issue! Submit a pull request! If you have ideas, let us know. Don't hold back — we want to hear your voice.
